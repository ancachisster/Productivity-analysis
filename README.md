Problem:

The UK Support Call Centre is experiencing performance issues. You are given the following datasets:
    1. An extract from our call centre software, which shows call activity
    2. UK appointment volumes
    
There are two initial hypotheses that they would like you to test:
    Hypothesis 1: Call centre performance has decreases over the period: 1 Feb 19 - 27 Apr 19
    Hypothesis 2: The change in call centre performance is due to poor agent performance
